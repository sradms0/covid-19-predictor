    "<p>\n",
    "Along with the rest of the world, the United States has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the country's handling of the virus, it has contributed to over nine million cases and over two-hundred thousand deaths on its citizens [1]. Safety measures, such as mask-wearing and social-distancing, have been enforced over time, but many still do not believe this helps prevent virus contraction, or do not take it seriously. And though studies on face-masks protecting one against the virus have been done, proving them to be effective, there is somehow still doubt [2].  \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Why such preventative measures are avoided should be questioned. There may be many factors contributing to this, but one specific component to focus on is politicism. Pew Research Center has conducted a recent survey of 9,220 respondents from August through September of 2020, asking Democrats and Republicans how the pandemic has \"affected them negatively [3].\" Based on their results, both groups had responded with many answers containing key phrases, such as \"family\", \"work\", \"friend\", and others, but also \"mask\". Ten percent of the democratic group responded with \"mask\", while nineteen percent of the Republican side answered with this phrase. Only a third of those with the phrase in their response expressed concern about \"other people refusing to wear them.\" The remaining were out of complaint.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The motivation of this study is to identify the relationship between COVID-19 contraction and political party affiliation in the United States. Other features, such as age, race, and gender will be used in combination with one's political party choice. The goal is to train a model that will predict whether or not one will contract this virus based on these mentioned features. We have focused on data from September 1, 2020 to November 1, 2020.\n",

For example, two sets county columns contain \"Autauga,\" and the other contains \"Autauga County,\" while only one also contains a county-id column. This was only one of the several problems. The remaining will be described in each section of where a cleaned dataset can be displayed. \n",

The office column is always \"President\", so it is redundant. The state_po column is abbreviations for the state and therefore redundant. There are multiple entries for counties/fips because of the different parties running for president. Each county had 1-4 party identifiers, republican, democrat, green, NA.

FIPS was created from combining State FIPS code and County FIPS code because in this data table they were separate. All years before the most recent were removed. All age groups under the voting age were removed. The remaining age group population values were summed up to get the population total that can vote in a county."
